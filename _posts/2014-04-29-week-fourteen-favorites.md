While this isn't the most exciting website out there, I love the separation of layers in the images and the scrolling/animation/"parallax" thing that's going on as the user scrolls down/the flight takes off. The plane's wing stays consistently still but the background changes as the plane rises which is shown in the little animated chart on the right of the screen. (I really want to take a private jet flight now.)
