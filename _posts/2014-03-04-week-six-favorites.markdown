##You Lost a Bet

I'm a sucker for when a great cause uses technology to put a playful spin on a not so playful topic to increase an awareness quickly. Ohio for Responsible Gambling created this campaign that has users post bets they lost using twitter and instagram hashtags. This probably utilizes a few simple APIs to bring the data together and it's smart the way it's layed out on the screen too. It doesn't perfectly wrap all the different sized elements but gets pretty close and it's responsive, which is of course a bonus. Users can also keep scrolling down and click on the "load more" to load more elements rather than it just automatically loading so many and slowing down the browser/page.
