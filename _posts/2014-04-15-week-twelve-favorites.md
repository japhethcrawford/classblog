My previous post on the headphones website – I'm pretty sure this is what was used to build the slider functionality. There are dozens of different sliders that can be implemented and they all vary in sizes and scope. some are meant to create the entire page, others are meant to just be a tiny little gallery. The pricing plans are a little confusing though, not sure what a subscription gets you over a one-time flat fee.
