(I forget the name of the studio/agency that put this together.. buuut)B&O Play headphones had a great site built to showcase their premium line of headphones. A onepage slider was used to split the page up into a few different sections that highlight different features of the headphones. The coolest section is an animated breakdown of how the headphone ports work â€“ which by the way, is pretty sweet. The animated transitions between all of the different sections is great.
