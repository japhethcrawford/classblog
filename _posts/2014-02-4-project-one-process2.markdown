This week I created some initial style/visual designs for the new site. I went with using a clean, sans-serif, Proxima Nova, for the type since I like the broad ranges of weights to use for main headlines and sub headlines. I'm not settled with a body copy typeface right now but a clear serif like Linden Hill is working in place for now.  
  
  
I've chosen to do an additional page which will be a public profile page that will show what a user is currently reading/watching/listening to/etc. and their top five in each category. This is a feature that not all users will probably want so it's a feature that can be disabled if desired. Also dealing with a person's profile/account.. from the homepage, a user can immediately see their current items they have checked out as well as what sort of outstanding fine they have, if applicable. They can pay right from the homepage. I'm still brainstorming what else would be useful/valuable in this little module.  
  
  
They page diagrams pdf provided above will also outline what exactly is going on in a few of the other pages.
