Active Theory is an interactive studio based out of Santa Monica, CA. They do work with everything from product design to motion design and it shows in their website right from the start. Their homepage uses WebGL to create an interactive.. animated.. abstract... thing. It's sweet. Diving deeper into their "lab" you can see even more of these creations that they've worked on. Some are more subtle in tracking mouse movement than others.
