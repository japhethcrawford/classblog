Barnyard is a branding agency with a sense of humor based out of Belgium. Their site took forever for me to load on multiple networks, but that was alright.. half of what I liked about their site was the little rooster loading icon with clever sayings that followed the theme of their name, barnyard. It loaded everytime the site was reloaded though so I would code it to only load once and then unless the cache was cleared, don't display that again. The parallaxing video/image before the fold on the homepage is pretty cool.
