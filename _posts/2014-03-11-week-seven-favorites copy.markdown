I work at a video production house here in Baltimore as a motion designer. When we deliver videos to our clients, we deliver the just the file. However, using various video service and social network APIs, we could deliver alongside the file, an analytics tool that they could use to monitor the performance of their video. 

This week I looked through API documentation for various sites to see what was available. So far it looks like it might just be YouTube and Vimeo that would work the best.
