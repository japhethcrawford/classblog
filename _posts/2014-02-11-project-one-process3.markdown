[Download Mockup]({{ site.url }}/assets/project1/MockupProfilePage.pdf)<br />
  
  
This week I mocked up a page that would have a lot of design elements that would be recycled on other pages. I chose to do the profile page which would feature the *Dashboard* of the user. Inside of that, will be the current books that are checked out as well as an easy to access button for each book to renew it and a reference to what the due date on that item was. To the right, is an easy to find balance on the user's account and a large pay fine button that allows a user to easily and discretely pay a fine for overdue books.   
  
  
This Dashboard originally was going to live on the homepage but I made the decision to focus on content on the homepage rather than administrative things. The main focus of the homepage is now to search both the site and the catalog at once in the hero image section as well as new books and events going on at the library. The profile page consists of a section of *recommended titles* and another with books my friends are reading. I have plans of implementing, possibly, a section that would be a shelf that the user would curate of favorite titles and a sort of.. queue list for books that the he or she wants to read/check out.

I also messed around a lot with bootstrap this week but I've chosen to stick to a more familiar framework rather than starting from square one and learning another framework in order to work at a faster pace.
