I'm checking into using AM Charts maybe for when I fully develop the Storyfarm analytics page for our clients to use. It's a tad pricey but I love the flexibility of all of the different chart types and the animation controls that are included. I like that you can at least download them and get them working before committing to paying for the license. All it does is just show a little website in the corner of your page.
