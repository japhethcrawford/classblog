This site solves the issue many studios face in displaying a wide variety of content in an interesting way. Each project, when viewed, transitions into a page with four panels that allow the user to watch the piece, click through stills from the process, and stills from the finished production, as well as a fourth panel that provides detailed information and credits for the piece. What I love most is how there's this seamless transition between pages that makes it seem like the viewer never really leaves that one first page. It's an endless stream of pages. Also the vignette on the lower portion of the screen is interesting.. sort of cinematic..
