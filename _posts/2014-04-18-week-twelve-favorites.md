Usually I'm not a fan of gimmicky trendy parallaxing sites but UStream's annual report is actually pretty great. The animations aren't all relient on the scrolling so it's not as annoying as some are. The only screen I don't like is about three or four down, where there are signs that are flipping.. you have to keep scrolling and scrolling to get to the next sign and to eventually, finally get to the next screen.. that's the "parallaxing" that i don't like.
