*College educated graphic designer*  
<br/>
####__How often do you go to the library?__
Not since college
<br/><br/>  
####__What do you go to the library for?__
Research, studying....should start going more often though, once I get through the books I own that I haven't read yet, I'll look to the library haha
<br/><br/> 
####__Do you ever use the library website? What for?__
Nope....used to in college for web based research databases and such
<br/><br/> 
####__Is there anything that frustrates you with the library or the library website?__
It had terrible functionality
<br/><br/> 
####__Do you use an iPad, Kindle, Nook, etc.? If so, how often?__
Kindle... Once a week at least, if there's a book I'm into. Sometimes I'll go a few months between those phases though
<br/><br/> 
####__Where do you read the most? Desktop? E-Reader?__
Probably tied between kindle and book
<br/><br/> 
####__If the entire library’s catalog was available in a digital format, would you ever still go to the physical building?__
Possibly. Sometimes it's good to get into that environment. And i still believe that you can't beat the printed word
<br/><br/> 
####__When reading on a desktop, is there anything that could be done to better your experience?__
Display features more like the kindle etc that'd make the screen easier on the eyes. Interactive highlighting features, taking notes in the margins.....all things about printed materials that aren't available in digital that discourage me from being more invested and engaged in my digital reading endeavors

##Danielle, Female, 33
*High School English Teacher*
<br/>
####__How often do you go to the library?__
I go to the library often; at least once a month, maybe more frequently if I’m looking for a book in particular or if I need a new audio book (no judging!) or if I need to return books.
<br/><br/> 
####__What do you go to the library for?__
Already answered a lot of this question, but I go to browse, to look for specific books, to get materials for school, to get audio books, and to do research.  I research both for teaching and for my Master’s (I have my Master’s in Liberal Arts, but I’m halfway through my Master’s in School Library Media.)
<br/><br/> 
####__Do you ever use the library website? What for?__
I am using the library webpage constantly.  I use it to check for fines (I am terrible at returning books on time), renewing books, and checking the library catalogue.  I would say I’m on it at least once a week, if not more, depending on how much time I have to read.  I also use it to check and download ebooks and audiobooks online.
<br/><br/> 
####__Is there anything that frustrates you with the library or the library website?__
They recently moved the Children’s Library downstairs where they used to have seating and tables and periodicals.  I think it was a big mistake, though I understand it was motivated by finances.  I believe they are reverting soon, but in the meantime there is no place to work or relax.  The funding was also cut from most of the databases.  There are very few available online; fewer than we have at school, actually.  If they mean to be a resource to the community, they should have more available.  I also lament the loss of being able to pay fines online.  Oh how I miss not getting the pitying (or just plain dirty) looks from the library staff when I bring books back late and have fines.  It was much better when I could pretend I was a good patron who never had fines (since I paid them online and the librarians didn’t know).
<br/><br/> 
####__Do you use an iPad, Kindle, Nook, etc.? If so, how often?__
I have a Kindle, but I most often read from my iPad.  Sometimes my iPhone when I’m caught out and in a line somewhere and I need something to read.  I use this less frequently; maybe 2-3 books a year?
<br/><br/> 
####__Where do you read the most? Desktop? E-Reader?__
I read books most.  It’s better for conversation starting and for the kids to see me reading.
<br/><br/> 
####__If the entire library’s catalog was available in a digital format, would you ever still go to the physical building?__
I’m not sure I could read everything digitally.  There’s something still to be said about holding the book and turning the pages, although I’m sure you’ve heard that argument many times.  Some books are just better read on paper (like Night Film, a book I just finished over Thanksgiving break! So good!).  Also I enjoy browsing both the stacks of books and audiobooks.  If you don’t know what you’re searching for, you won’t be able to find it in an online search, but you can in person.   Later this semester I’ll be taking some personal days to work on my National Board Certification, and having space and quiet at the library is something else you cannot find online.
<br/><br/> 
####__When reading on a desktop, is there anything that could be done to better your experience?__
I don’t like reading on a desk/laptop.  The screen often burns into my vision and I have to look away to regain my optimum eyesight (hard to explain, but I just can’t read for long).  I wouldn’t read anything lengthy on a desk or laptop.

##Corinne, Female, 42
*College Educated, Production Director at a Video Production house*
<br/>
####__How often do you go to the library?__
I go to the library once a week, if possible
<br/><br/> 
####__What do you go to the library for?__
I go for exercise DVDs and movies, generally. Sometimes books.
<br/><br/> 
####__Do you ever use the library website? What for?__
I use the website for renewals and I once used the website for a consumer report for a washer.
<br/><br/> 
####__Is there anything that frustrates you with the library or the library website?__
My use of the website is limited, so I don't get frustrated.
<br/><br/> 
####__Do you use an iPad, Kindle, Nook, etc.? If so, how often?__
I use an ipad (but not for the library)
<br/><br/> 
####__Where do you read the most? Desktop? E-Reader?__
I read physical books (when I read them)
<br/><br/> 
####__If the entire library’s catalog was available in a digital format, would you ever still go to the physical building?__
I would still go to the library to pick up DVDs.  I really like the library.  I think it's a nice place for people to go, away from the home for peace and quiet.  Not everything should be digital.
<br/><br/> 
####__When reading on a desktop, is there anything that could be done to better your experience?__
I don't like reading on a desktop.  I prefer the physical book.

#Conclusion
I found it strange how few of my friends actually read let alone use the library, and when they do it's only for research sort of stuff. It seems like most still don't exactly want to read entire books on desktop screens but would rather only read shorter length things. Also, Danielle's point about how the library she frequents no longer allows her to pay her fines online was interesting. I feel like that would be an easy fix and could be addressed alongside of keeping track of a user's inventory of items that are checked out. No one even mentioned how horrible it is to actually browse the selection of books on the library website is. If you don't have an exact title you're looking for, it's useless. The website doesn't recreate the physical experience of walking through shelves and shelves of books to see what sticks out in areas that you're interested in. Books could easily be organized into the Dewey Decimal system online (or something better for the online experience) to recreate that browsing.
