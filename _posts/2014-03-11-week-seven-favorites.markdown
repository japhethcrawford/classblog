This nifty little site allows you to install a plugin/addon to your browser that allows it to look into your history and analyze your web browsing habits and displays it all in an animated infographic. I did this hesitantly since.. it's really giving them a lot of info probably and I wouldn't be too happy with cached credit card info getting out and such but I took the chance. It was cool that it threw together the data so quickly, but of course it was only limited to what internet history/cache was on the Macbook Air I was using at the time which I only use a few times a week. It also was sort of a let down to see the same data just displayed in different ways.
