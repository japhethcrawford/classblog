Webflow is certainly.. interesting. I've just signed up for a free trial and I haven't really had that much time to mess around with it yet, but Webflow claims to be able to code things perfectly and neatly, taking your input from their modules.. creating different states and then assigning the way the states are changed.. the transitions. Theoretically, a user could sign up for the lowest account to build the code, export it, and use it on an already hosted site.
